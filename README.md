# order-manager
Order Manager is a Qt/SQL/Python based tool for tracking special orders, warranty claims, and online orders in a retail scenario. The tool was designed for the specific demands by IBDs (Independent Bicycle Dealers) but can be useful in many different retail/service scenarios. Order Manager is network-based and cross platform, making it incredibly flexible for businesses with multiple locations and/or with equipment running multiple different operating systems. Order Manager also features WooCommerce API connectivity, allowing you to keep track of customer orders and send payment requests without needing to login to wp-admin in a broswer. This is especially handy for locked-down POS computers with restricted web access, or scenarios where WordPress login credentials can't be given out to employees.

Order Manager is currently in Beta stages, and is considered useable but incomplete.
